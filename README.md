# WindowMover
Retrieve windows when they fly off to another screen that is on the otherside of the room!

### TOOL BUILT ON/WITH
---------------
Programming language: C#, Windows forms (yeah, yeah, I know, forget you :P)

IDE: Visual Studio 2013

O/S: MS Windows 7

### REASON FOR BEING
---------------
Having a television on the other side of the room connected to my computer, I was forever getting wound up due to the windows flying over 
to said TV whenever I turned it on. Therefore, and finally, I have created this tool, which will allow you to select the windows and move
 them back to the main screen.
